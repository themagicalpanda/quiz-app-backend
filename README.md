# Quiz App - API-based Backend

This is a RESTful API-based quiz application that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive feedback on their performance. The app uses an in-memory database to store quizzes, questions, and user responses.

## Features

- **Create Quiz**: Add a new quiz with multiple-choice questions.
- **Get Quiz**: Retrieve a quiz by its ID without revealing the correct answers.
- **Submit Answer**: Submit an answer for a specific question and receive immediate feedback (correct or incorrect).
- **Get Results**: Fetch the userâ€™s results for a quiz, including score and a summary of their answers.

## API Endpoints

### Improvements
- **Scoring Logic Enhancement**: The app needs a better scoring system that updates based on answers and shows the correct score in the results for accurate feedback.
